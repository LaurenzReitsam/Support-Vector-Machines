# Support-Vector-Machines

Implementing SVM from scratch

--------------------------------
This project illustrates how support vector machines can be implemented from scratch using python.

**SVM.py** contains the main code of the SVM implementation.

**Plotting.py** contains additional code to create charts.

**testing_SVM.ipynb** is a Jupyter Notebook containg some basic tests and visualizations.
